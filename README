
INSTALLATION

Bluestone can be used in your PHP application by placing its files
into any directory on the server.

In your application configuration, you should define where the bluestone
files are using the BLUESTONE_DIR constant.  Include the trailing slash.
For example,

define(BLUESTONE_DIR, '/path/to/bluestone/');
