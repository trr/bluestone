
Bluestone PHP Library
=====================

A general purpose PHP library for web applications

The Bluestone project includes classes for handling:

- simple debugging, including backtraces
- MySQL database connections
- identifying file types based on content
- creating and altering database tables to match a scheme
- handling lots of features of HTTP including resuming and gzip encoding
- diff (comparing two files)
- validating, filtering and converting UTF-8 encoded strings
- simple conversion between text and HTML (ie, paragraph tags and not much more)

Compatible with PHP 5.2.4 and above. Some functionality in Bluestone may also be
provided by PHP extensions currently available, but is included in Bluestone for
maximum portability. For example, basic UTF-8 support such as validating and
filtering invalid characters, case conversion and word separation without the need
for users to install the mbstring extension.

Installation and use
====================

Bluestone can be used in your PHP application by placing its files
into any directory on the server.

In your application configuration, you should define where the bluestone
files are using the BLUESTONE_DIR constant.  Include the trailing slash.
For example,

define(BLUESTONE_DIR, '/path/to/bluestone/');
